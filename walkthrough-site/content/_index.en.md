title: 'Yurtyme'

Yur-Tyme was formed during the Fall of 2014, when a class titled Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Business Transformation at the Harvard Extension School asked its students to put together an idea and develop an initiative towards pursuing their goals. During brainstorming sessions, our team concluded the greatest waste of time we encounter is waiting in line, so that became our problem to solve. We want to minimize the amount of time spent in waiting line “purgatory” to allow our users and members to increase the amount of time actually doing the things they set out to do!
