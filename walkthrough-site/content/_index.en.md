title: 'Yurtyme'
---

After he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, Steve Jobs gave a commencement address at Stanford University titled “How to Live before You Die.”

In that address, Steve Jobs concluded, “Your time is limited, so don't waste it.. While Steve was specifically referencing “working for someone else,” this basic precept of not “wasting time” is salient.

Yur-Tyme was formed during the Fall of 2014, when a class titled Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Business Transformation at the Harvard Extension School asked its students to put together an idea and develop an initiative towards pursuing their goals. During brainstorming sessions, our team concluded the greatest waste of time we encounter is waiting in line, so that became our problem to solve. We want to minimize the amount of time spent in waiting line “purgatory” to allow our users and members to increase the amount of time actually doing the things they set out to do!

At the time, I used all the latest and greatest cloud services to design the below backend for yurtyme...

6 years later and the technology landscape widely different how would I alter my approach?
