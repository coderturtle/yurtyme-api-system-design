If you have a website, application, or another web resource, you probably have static content. Static content includes files like images, videos, or music, or even scripts like .css or js. In the pre-cloud era, you would put those files on a standard server, and then serve them on the internet to all of your viewers, across the globe, from one specific geo location.
