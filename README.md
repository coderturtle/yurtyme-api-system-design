# Yurtyme System Design 2020

![yurtyme](/images/yurtyme.png)

Yur-Tyme was formed during the Fall of 2014, when a class titled Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Business Transformation at the Harvard Extension School asked its students to put together an idea and develop an initiative towards pursuing their goals. During brainstorming sessions, our team concluded the greatest waste of time we encounter is waiting in line, so that became our problem to solve. We want to minimize the amount of time spent in waiting line “purgatory” to allow our users and members to increase the amount of time actually doing the things they set out to do!

Technology and available cloud services was much different in 2014 and below is the high level architecture I designed for the backend...

A full spec for the system can be found in the Software Architecture section of the Business Plan in the docs folder.

But fast forward 6 years and we live in a much different world... If I looked at this today how would I design the system differently?

Using [hugo](https://gohugo.io) I created an interactive architecture walkthrough of what a potential yurtyme backend would look like today.

This is available at [Yurtyme System Design Walkthrough](https://coderturtle.github.io/yurtyme-api-system-design).

There is also an initial API spec available at [Apiary](https://yurtyme.docs.apiary.io/#)
